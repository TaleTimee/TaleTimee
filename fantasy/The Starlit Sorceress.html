            <p>In the village of Lyndale, a young girl named Mira was born beneath a sky streaked with falling stars. The elders called it an omen, and Mira grew up knowing she was destined for greatnessâ€”or doom.</p>

<p>At sixteen, Mira discovered she could wield starlight, summoning it to illuminate the darkest nights and heal the gravely injured. Word of her power spread, drawing the attention of the Sorcerer King, who sought to claim her abilities for himself.</p>

<p>When his army marched on Lyndale, Mira stood at the villageâ€™s edge, her hands glowing with celestial energy. The battle that followed was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. Mira summoned the stars themselves, raining light down upon the invaders. But each spell drained her, and she feared she would not last.</p>

<p>As the Sorcerer King confronted her, Mira unleashed her final act of defianceâ€”a burst of light so powerful it shattered his dark magic. Though victorious, Mira collapsed, her energy spent.</p>

<p>The villagers carried her back, vowing to protect her as she had protected them. From that day forward, Mira was known as the Starlit Sorceress, a legend who inspired hope across the land.</p>
