            In the heart of the desert lay a canyon surrounded by myths. Twelve-year-old Ethan and his friend Maya discovered an ancient map in Ethan's attic. Intrigued, they decided to investigate. With only their bikes and some supplies, they pedaled into the wilderness. The deeper they ventured, the eerier the surroundings became. Mysterious symbols lined the canyon walls, glowing faintly in the moonlight. Suddenly, the ground trembled, revealing a hidden passage. Their curiosity pushed them forward, leading to a chamber filled with dazzling crystals and an ancient artifactâ€”a compass glowing with unnatural energy. However, a shadow moved, and a chilling growl echoed. They realized they were not alone. They raced back, the compass clutched in Ethan's hand. Though they escaped, the compass kept pointing toward unknown places, hinting their adventure was just beginning.
