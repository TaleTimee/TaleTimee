            <p>In a bustling city hospital, Dr. Rebecca Lin specialized in nonverbal communication. Her patients were those who couldn‚Äôt speak‚Äîstroke survivors, trauma victims, and children with developmental disorders. She believed that the body spoke when the mouth couldn‚Äôt, and her mission was to listen.</p>

<p>One of her most challenging cases was Leo, a young boy who hadn‚Äôt spoken a word since witnessing a tragic car accident. His parents were desperate for answers, but Leo remained locked in his silent world. Rebecca observed him closely, noting his every movement, expression, and gesture.</p>

<p>Leo would draw the same picture repeatedly: a red car, a tree, and a broken fence. Rebecca used this as a starting point, asking him to add details to his drawings. Over time, Leo began to include people in his sketches‚Äîa man, a woman, and a small child.</p>

<p>Rebecca realized that Leo was reliving the accident through his art. She introduced a therapy dog, Max, to help ease his anxiety. Slowly, Leo began to open up, first to Max, then to Rebecca. His first words came during a session where he hugged the dog and whispered, ‚ÄúSafe.‚Äù</p>

<p>From there, the floodgates opened. Leo described the accident and his fear that it had been his fault. Rebecca reassured him that he wasn‚Äôt to blame, helping him process his emotions and rebuild his confidence. Leo‚Äôs recovery became a testament to the power of empathy and the unspoken language of the human body.</p>
