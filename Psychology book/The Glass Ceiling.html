            <p>Dr. Nora Bennett was a psychologist specializing in workplace dynamics. Her latest client, Karen, was a high-achieving executive who felt stuck in her career. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like there‚Äôs an invisible barrier holding me back,‚Äù Karen said during their first session.</p>

<p>Nora introduced Karen to the concept of the ‚Äúglass ceiling,‚Äù the unseen obstacles that often hinder women in male-dominated industries. They explored Karen‚Äôs work environment, analyzing her interactions with colleagues and superiors.</p>

<p>Through their sessions, Nora uncovered a pattern. Karen often hesitated to voice her ideas in meetings, fearing they wouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously. She also downplayed her achievements, attributing her success to luck rather than skill.</p>

<p>Nora used cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge Karen‚Äôs self-doubt. She encouraged Karen to keep a journal of her accomplishments and practice assertiveness in small ways. Gradually, Karen began to see herself in a new light‚Äînot as an impostor, but as a capable, deserving professional.</p>

<p>When Karen finally confronted her boss about a promotion she had earned, she did so with confidence. The glass ceiling didn‚Äôt shatter overnight, but cracks began to form. Karen‚Äôs journey inspired Nora to develop workshops for women, helping them break through barriers and claim their rightful place in the professional world.</p>
